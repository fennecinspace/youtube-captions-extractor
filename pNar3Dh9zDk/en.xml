dur="4.08">soon as things get a little difficult I</text><text start="64.439" dur="4.261">get bored and I move on to something</text><text start="66.689" dur="5.731">else and this could be for even

dur="3.87">has an end to it it&amp;#39;s just something</text><text start="109.36" dur="3.48">that keeps going and going and going and</text><text start="110.89" dur="3.69">going I wanted to have that

that I decided okay I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="123.16" dur="3.66">read a book and I&amp;#39;m leaving if I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="124.87" dur="4.77">like it I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text><text start="126.82" dur="5.22">finishing it finish it so I started off</text><text start="129.64" dur="4.71">with reading sci-fi and to be fair I</text><text start="132.04" dur="4.8">didn&amp;#39;t really enjoyed that much I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="134.35" dur="3.99">still buying I read it and I knew I</text><text start="136.84" dur="3.6">wanted to read something different next</text><text start="138.34" dur="4.05">and I really enjoyed that and it just</text><text start="140.44" dur="4.95">sort of came moved on and on and on and</text><text start="142.39" dur="5.58">Here I am later and I&amp;#39;m so happy I&amp;#39;m so</text><text start="145.39" dur="4.68">glad I made this decision one of the</text><text start="147.97" dur="4.05">major discoveries for me this year was</text><text start="150.07" dur="3.96">discovering my favorite author which I</text><text start="152.02" dur="4.32">talked a lot about on this channel which</text><text start="154.03" dur="4.41">is Yukio Mishima didn&amp;#39;t know anything</text><text start="156.34" dur="4.14">about this author when I read him which</text><text start="158.44" dur="3.54">I think really added to the effect for</text><text start="160.48" dur="3.69">me so I almost don&amp;#39;t want to talk about</text><text start="161.98" dur="4.86">him because discovering him as was</text><text start="164.17" dur="5.19">equally as fun almost or really added to</text><text start="166.84" dur="4.38">the experience for me I it out on</text><text start="169.36" dur="3.69">Twitter asking if there was any</text><text start="171.22" dur="3.69">recommendations for Japanese authors</text><text start="173.05" dur="3.75">because I enjoyed reading the more I</text><text start="174.91" dur="4.14">count me and I didn&amp;#39;t really expect much</text><text start="176.8" dur="4.05">of it I thought Yukio was a female name</text><text start="179.05" dur="3.719">I thought it was a female author because</text><text start="180.85" dur="4.109">when I read the Sailor fell from grace</text><text start="182.769" dur="4.081">would see I just felt so incompletely</text><text start="184.959" dur="3.391">merged into the main character&amp;#39;s mind</text><text start="186.85" dur="3.33">which is something I never really</text><text start="188.35" dur="3.66">experienced before with literature even</text><text start="190.18" dur="5.22">though this character this young boy</text><text start="192.01" dur="5.759">very special to say the least I I was I</text><text start="195.4" dur="4.47">was there I was into it and I felt like</text><text start="197.769" dur="3.241">I got a window into that time and period</text><text start="199.87" dur="5.52">when this was written</text><text start="201.01" dur="6.72">and that really is why I was so drawn to</text><text start="205.39" dur="4.77">his literature afterwards studying the</text><text start="207.73" dur="4.89">book learning about Yukio Mishima is</text><text start="210.16" dur="5.16">life you certainly learn more about the</text><text start="212.62" dur="5.19">meaning the symbolism and the ideas that</text><text start="215.32" dur="5.82">motivated his work which makes it even</text><text start="217.81" dur="5.55">more interesting so I think that&amp;#39;s why</text><text start="221.14" dur="2.95">for me you commissioned had such an</text><text start="223.36" dur="2.409">impact this</text><text start="224.09" dur="3.96">and also reading more about his</text><text start="225.769" dur="4.951">non-fictional work like son steel for</text><text start="228.05" dur="5.37">example it was his way of living he he</text><text start="230.72" dur="5.37">wanted to reintroduce the samurai way of</text><text start="233.42" dur="5.94">living into Japan and a lot of his book</text><text start="236.09" dur="5.399">reflects that idea on the ship that</text><text start="239.36" dur="3.9">Japan went through during the Meiji</text><text start="241.489" dur="4.681">period shortly after the Second World</text><text start="243.26" dur="4.92">War this is sorry this is the point is</text><text start="246.17" dur="4.59">he wrote summon steel which was for a</text><text start="248.18" dur="5.339">magazine and he was an avid body lifter</text><text start="250.76" dur="6.87">weightlifter which is not your typical I</text><text start="253.519" dur="6.84">guess writer hobby because he believed</text><text start="257.63" dur="4.74">in Sun and steel which is his take on</text><text start="260.359" dur="4.501">the old and old samurai saying the</text><text start="262.37" dur="4.91">flower and the sword as oversimplifying</text><text start="264.86" dur="5.45">it but basically it was this idea that</text><text start="267.28" dur="5.68">samurais should spend just as much time</text><text start="270.31" dur="6.16">writing poetry as they spend time</text><text start="272.96" dur="5.85">practicing with their sword and Mishima</text><text start="276.47" dur="4.83">felt like Japan had forgotten about</text><text start="278.81" dur="5.34">their steel or the sword of Japan and</text><text start="281.3" dur="5.28">especially during the westernization of</text><text start="284.15" dur="6.75">Japan a lot of his work like runaway</text><text start="286.58" dur="8.49">horses his tetralogy in the temple of</text><text start="290.9" dur="6.48">dawn they all reflect this this shift it</text><text start="295.07" dur="4.83">was also obsessed with the idea of dying</text><text start="297.38" dur="5.039">young and he really dramatis eyes that</text><text start="299.9" dur="4.65">and Mishima was supposed to win the</text><text start="302.419" dur="3.87">Nobel Prize he was supposed to be one of</text><text start="304.55" dur="3.03">the first winners this sort of became an</text><text start="306.289" dur="3.63">essay I don&amp;#39;t know why I didn&amp;#39;t mean</text><text start="307.58" dur="5.04">sorry I just I like talking about</text><text start="309.919" dur="4.231">Mishima he was a poet because it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="312.62" dur="3.479">interesting he was supposed to win them</text><text start="314.15" dur="4.23">the Nobel Prize but he was kind of a</text><text start="316.099" dur="5.761">misunderstood character and still fairly</text><text start="318.38" dur="4.98">young to receive such an award so he he</text><text start="321.86" dur="6.119">got snob then he went to one of his</text><text start="323.36" dur="6.3">peers instead and I think twice even he</text><text start="327.979" dur="3.721">was supposed to win the Nobel Prize it</text><text start="329.66" dur="4.92">was sort of taken that yeah he&amp;#39;s still</text><text start="331.7" dur="4.83">young we don&amp;#39;t really know who he is yet</text><text start="334.58" dur="4.86">so when he gets older it will probably</text><text start="336.53" dur="4.65">get the award but four people are know</text><text start="339.44" dur="4.11">by Mishima he never made it that far</text><text start="341.18" dur="4.47">the very fact fascinating author his</text><text start="343.55" dur="4.11">life is equally as fascinating as his</text><text start="345.65" dur="3.69">work so that has been one of my favorite</text><text start="347.66" dur="2.979">things that I discovered this year just</text><text start="349.34" dur="4.62">reading his books I</text><text start="350.639" dur="6.96">loved it I read his tetralogy I read</text><text start="353.96" dur="7.15">someone who I guess more weird stuff his</text><text start="357.599" dur="6.241">short stories there&amp;#39;s so much great work</text><text start="361.11" dur="4.799">from him that I just I feel I enjoy</text><text start="363.84" dur="4.199">every page that I read the second thing</text><text start="365.909" dur="3.75">that I really enjoyed discovering this</text><text start="368.039" dur="4.551">year which is something that I never</text><text start="369.659" dur="6.181">thought I would say which is Buddhism</text><text start="372.59" dur="5.65">that&amp;#39;s right everybody I think a lot of</text><text start="375.84" dur="5.039">people can benefit from Buddhism not</text><text start="378.24" dur="4.47">from a religious thing fun but just I</text><text start="380.879" dur="3.6">think if you embrace Buddhism as a</text><text start="382.71" dur="4.44">philosophy there&amp;#39;s so much to learn</text><text start="384.479" dur="6.09">especially for me I think with the ideas</text><text start="387.15" dur="4.41">around self-control and why you</text><text start="390.569" dur="2.641">shouldn&amp;#39;t indulge in the</text><text start="391.56" dur="3.719">self-destructive behavior just is</text><text start="393.21" dur="3.419">something man I really benefited from</text><text start="395.279" dur="3.57">and it&amp;#39;s something that I never really</text><text start="396.629" dur="3.72">was taught so I&amp;#39;m really glad I read</text><text start="398.849" dur="3.69">this book I picked it up on a complete</text><text start="400.349" dur="4.171">win and the Sun came out of nowhere and</text><text start="402.539" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m getting blasted like an inferno</text><text start="404.52" dur="5.04">Jesus I find it interesting cuz a lot of</text><text start="406.919" dur="5.34">its ideas on why you shouldn&amp;#39;t indulge</text><text start="409.56" dur="4.379">in self-destructive behavior sort of</text><text start="412.259" dur="4.291">correlates to another book that I read</text><text start="413.939"

dur="5.67">observation that people that you know</text><text start="427.86" dur="4.83">started smoking or the self-destructive</text><text start="430.44" dur="5.069">things on the camp&amp;#39;s avoid the people</text><text start="432.69" dur="4.289">that had kind of given up on on in</text><text start="435.509" dur="4.201">general and these were the people that</text><text start="436.979" dur="4.47">would soon after obviously not for</text><text start="439.71" dur="3.87">everyone but would pass away because</text><text start="441.449" dur="4.261">they they lost their meaning that they</text><text start="443.58" dur="5.97">lost their their grip I guess you could</text><text start="445.71" dur="7.079">say you know Here I am privileged little</text><text start="449.55" dur="5.039">sweet boy why should I do these</text><text start="452.789" dur="4.111">self-destructive things what&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="454.589" dur="4.35">meaning for me to do that and

because</text><text start="507.87" dur="3.24">I think that&amp;#39;s something that a lot of</text><text start="509.22" dur="4.199">people like to start off reading myself</text><text start="511.11"

I&amp;#39;m bringing this up is</text><text start="533.22" dur="5.07">because a lot of you guys are</text><text start="535.14" dur="5.91">recommending this book to me which is</text><text start="538.29" dur="5.61">Fahrenheit 451 which is another dystopia</text><text start="541.05" dur="4.89">which depicts a future where people</text><text start="543.9" dur="4.38">won&amp;#39;t read
