That&amp;#39;s right.</text><text start="7.76" dur="2.7">In 2018 I read 72 books</text><text start="11.43" dur="2.69">here in my garage and this is all my</text><text start="14.12" dur="0.75">knowledge</text><text start="15.31" dur="2.83">And the other dead means 28 year old man</text><text start="18.14" dur="1.41">discovers books is a thing.</text><text start="22.01" dur="3">It&amp;#39;s the end of the year and I wanted to make a sort</text><text start="25.01" dur="3">of summary and talk about some of my favorite books that</text><text start="28.01" dur="2.88">I read this year. And I also wanted to make this book to</text><text start="30.89" dur="2.97">hopefully inspire you guys or more people in general to read</text><text start="33.86" dur="2.88">as well. The percentage of teenagers that read for fun</text><text start="37.04" dur="1.44">is at an all time low.</text><text start="39.14" dur="1.98">Let&amp;#39;s change that. Oh yeah.</text><text start="41.36" dur="2.25">The reason why I started reading was</text><text start="43.67" dur="2.97">because I made actually</text><text start="46.64" dur="2.88">a New Year&amp;#39;s resolution so I thought OK well maybe</text><text start="49.7" dur="2.97">this could. You guys can take the same resolution. Maybe</text><text start="52.67" dur="2.82">you guys have the same problem as I had which is that</text><text start="56.12" dur="2.73">I kind of have a problem with finishing</text><text start="58.85" dur="2.19">things. Sounds a bit weird but</text><text start="61.22" dur="2.52">generally as soon as things get a little</text><text start="63.74" dur="2.97">difficult I get bored and I move on to something</text><text start="66.71" dur="2.7">else and this could be for even silly stuff like.</text><text start="70.46" dur="2.91">Playing a video game. If it gets boring at some</text><text start="73.37" dur="2.79">point I don&amp;#39;t really care to finish and I&amp;#39;ll just buy a new</text><text start="76.16" dur="2.82">game or move on to something else or whether it&amp;#39;s a hobby</text><text start="78.98" dur="2.19">project as soon as it gets a little boring.</text><text start="81.2" dur="2.89">I generally don&amp;#39;t finish it so I.</text><text start="84.74" dur="2.76">I miss that feeling I&amp;#39;m finishing</text><text start="87.5" dur="2.88">something I missed that gratifying feeling though you</text><text start="90.38" dur="1.92">know even if it wasn&amp;#39;t the most fun.</text><text start="93.62" dur="2.95">I still am glad I went through with it. I&amp;#39;m so glad</text><text start="96.57" dur="2.66">that I can move onto the next thing. Preachy</text><text start="99.23" dur="2.94">moment incoming and NG in case hasn&amp;#39;t been preachy</text><text start="102.17" dur="2.97">enough so far I think especially with social media as</text><text start="105.14" dur="2.85">well we should literally never has an end</text><text start="107.99" dur="2.91">to it. It&amp;#39;s just something that keeps going and going and going and</text><text start="110.9" dur="2.91">going. I wanted to have that feeling so I said by my new</text><text start="113.81" dur="2.88">year&amp;#39;s resolution was going to be that no matter what I do I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="116.69" dur="2.85">finish it. And I didn&amp;#39;t have books in mind at all.</text><text start="119.72" dur="2.73">It just sort of became a coincidence that I decided</text><text start="122.51" dur="2.86">OK I&amp;#39;ll read a book and I&amp;#39;m leaving if I don&amp;#39;t like it.</text><text start="125.72" dur="3">I don&amp;#39;t care. I&amp;#39;m just going to finishing it. Finish it. So</text><text start="129.08" dur="3">I start off with reading sci fi and to be fair</text><text start="132.08" dur="2.94">I didn&amp;#39;t really enjoyed that much. I&amp;#39;m so glad I</text><text start="135.02" dur="2.82">read it and I knew I wanted to read something</text><text start="137.84" dur="2.85">different next. And I really enjoyed that and they just sort of</text><text start="140.69" dur="2.7">came and moved on and on and on and here I am</text><text start="143.39" dur="2.64">later and I&amp;#39;m so happy. I&amp;#39;m so glad I made</text><text start="146.03" dur="1.44">this decision.</text><text start="147.59" dur="2.58">One of the major discoveries for me this year was</text><text start="150.17" dur="2.7">discovering my favorite author which I talked a lot about</text><text start="152.87" dur="2.67">on this channel which is Yukio me Shima.</text><text start="155.75" dur="2.82">Didn&amp;#39;t know anything about this author when I read him which I</text><text start="158.57" dur="2.97">think really added to the effect for me so I almost don&amp;#39;t want</text><text start="161.54" dur="2.7">to talk about him because discovering him as was</text><text start="164.24" dur="2.82">equally as fun almost or really added to the</text><text start="167.06" dur="2.82">experience for me. I tweeted out on Twitter</text><text start="169.93" dur="2.71">asking if there was any recommendations for Japanese</text><text start="172.64" dur="2.87">authors because I enjoyed reading them more Academy</text><text start="175.66" dur="2.74">and at air really expect much of it. I thought Yukio was a</text><text start="178.4" dur="2.58">female name. I thought it was a female author because</text><text start="181.34" dur="2.81">when I read this elite fell from grace I could see I just felt sewing</text><text start="184.18" dur="2.92">could completely merge into the main character&amp;#39;s mind</text><text start="187.43" dur="3">which is something I never really experienced before with literature even</text><text start="190.43" dur="2.82">though this character this young boy very special to</text><text start="193.25" dur="3">say the least I was. I was there I</text><text start="196.25" dur="2.88">was into it and I felt like I got a window into that</text><text start="199.13" dur="2.97">time and period when this was written. And</text><text start="202.36" dur="2.77">that really is why I was so</text><text start="205.13" dur="2.85">drawn to his literature afterwards studying the book</text><text start="207.98" dur="2.67">learning about Yukio emission man&amp;#39;s life</text><text start="211.01" dur="2.13">you certainly learn more about the meaning the</text><text start="213.14" dur="2.94">symbolism and the ideas that motivated</text><text start="216.2" dur="2.73">his work which makes it even more interesting.</text><text start="220.16" dur="2.87">So I think that&amp;#39;s why for me you mission man had</text><text start="223.04" dur="2.76">such an impact this year and also reading more about his</text><text start="225.8" dur="2.76">nonfiction work like Sun and steel for example.</text><text start="228.63" dur="2.6">That was his way of living he he wanted to</text><text start="231.23" dur="2.76">reintroduce the samurai way of living into</text><text start="233.99" dur="2.91">Japan and a lot of his book reflects that</text><text start="236.9" dur="2.76">idea on the shift that</text><text start="239.75" dur="2.79">Japan went through during the Meiji period. Shortly</text><text start="242.54" dur="2.97">after the Second World War I hate to say this but</text><text start="245.63" dur="2.61">the point is he wrote sun and steel which it was for a</text><text start="248.24" dur="2.56">magazine and he was an avid body lifter</text><text start="250.86" dur="2.96">weightlifting which is not your typical I</text><text start="253.82" dur="2.09">guess rider hobby.</text><text start="256.79" dur="2.73">Because he believed in sun and steel which is</text><text start="259.52" dur="2.85">his take on the old an old samurai saying the</text><text start="262.37" dur="2.79">flower and the sword. That&amp;#39;s oversimplifying it</text><text start="265.22" dur="2.16">but basically it was his idea that</text><text start="267.74" dur="3">samurai should spend just as much time</text><text start="270.92" dur="2.43">writing poetry as they spend time</text><text start="273.41" dur="2.97">practicing with their sword and missing</text><text start="276.38" dur="2.91">my felt like. Japan had forgotten about their</text><text start="279.29" dur="2.64">steel or the sword of Japan. And</text><text start="281.93" dur="2.79">especially during the westernisation of Japan. A</text><text start="284.72" dur="2.73">lot of his work like runaway horses.</text><text start="289.25" dur="2.7">Is technology in the Temple of Dawn. They will</text><text start="291.95" dur="3">reflect this this shift.</text><text start="294.98" dur="2.76">He was also obsessed with the idea of dying</text><text start="297.83" dur="2.45">young and he really dramatic size. And</text><text start="300.53" dur="2.73">Mishima was supposed to win the Nobel Prize he was</text><text start="303.26" dur="2.97">supposed to be one of the first winners. This sort of became</text><text start="306.23" dur="2.88">an essay I don&amp;#39;t know why I didn&amp;#39;t mean sorry I just. I</text><text start="309.14" dur="2.9">like talking about male Schmidt. He was a poet.</text><text start="312.18" dur="2.78">It is very interesting. He was supposed to win the Nobel</text><text start="314.96" dur="2.52">Prize but he was kind of a misunderstood character and</text><text start="317.75" dur="2.43">still is fairly young to receive such an award.</text><text start="320.21" dur="2.97">So he he got snob. Then he went to one</text><text start="323.18" dur="2.85">of his peers. Instead. And</text><text start="326.78" dur="2.91">I think twice as even he was supposed to win the Nobel Prize. It</text><text start="329.69" dur="2.88">was sort of taken back. He&amp;#39;s still young. We</text><text start="332.57" dur="2.94">don&amp;#39;t really know who he is yet. So when he</text><text start="335.51" dur="2.88">gets older it will probably get the award. But</text><text start="338.78" dur="2.64">for people I know by Miss Sharma he never made it that far to</text><text start="341.43" dur="2.78">verify it. Fascinating author. His life is</text><text start="344.27" dur="2.94">equally as fascinating as his work so that has been one of</text><text start="347.21" dur="2.97">my favorite things that I discovered this year. Just reading his books</text><text start="350.21" dur="2.94">I absolutely loved it. I read his technology.</text><text start="353.39" dur="2.97">I read someone who is I guess more weird</text><text start="356.69" dur="2.16">stuff. His short stories</text><text start="360.56" dur="2.79">so much great work from him that I just I feel</text><text start="363.53" dur="2.67">I enjoy every page that I read. The second thing that I</text><text start="366.2" dur="2.83">really enjoyed discovering this year which is</text><text start="369.03" dur="2.87">something that I never thought I would say which is Buddhism.</text><text start="373.37" dur="2.85">That&amp;#39;s right everybody. I think a lot of people</text><text start="376.22" dur="3">can benefit from the critics not from a religious</text><text start="379.22" dur="2.82">thing from but just I think if you embrace</text><text start="382.1" dur="2.52">Buddhism as a philosophy there&amp;#39;s so much to learn</text><text start="384.86" dur="2.64">especially for me. I think with the ideas around</text><text start="387.5" dur="2.55">self. Control and</text><text start="390.29" dur="2.94">why you should indulge in self-destructive behavior that is</text><text start="393.23" dur="2.97">something that I really benefited from and it&amp;#39;s something that I</text><text start="396.2" dur="2.88">never really was taught so I&amp;#39;m really glad I read this</text><text start="399.08" dur="2.97">book I picked it up on a complete win and the sun came out of</text><text start="402.05" dur="2.49">nowhere and I&amp;#39;m getting blasted like an inferno.</text><text start="404.57" dur="2.85">Jesus Christ. I find it interesting because a lot of its</text><text start="407.57" dur="2.88">ideas on why you shouldn&amp;#39;t indulge in self-destructive</text><text start="410.48" dur="2.94">behavior sort of correlates to another book</text><text start="413.45" dur="2.43">that I read. I&amp;#39;ve talked about before which is</text><text start="416.33" dur="2.85">Man&amp;#39;s Search for Meaning by Victor you Frankl who</text><text start="419.18" dur="2.93">is a Holocaust survivor. He survived I think two or three</text><text start="422.12" dur="2.67">concentration camps and he made the</text><text start="424.79" dur="2.98">observation that people that you</text><text start="427.77" dur="2.71">know started smoking or did these self-destructive</text><text start="430.49" dur="2.61">things on the camps avoid the people that had</text><text start="433.28" dur="3">kind of given up on on in general and</text><text start="436.28" dur="2.16">these were the people that would soon after.</text><text start="438.92" dur="2.89">Obviously not for everyone but would pass away because they</text><text start="442.19" dur="2.96">they lost their meaning there they lost their their grip</text><text start="445.16" dur="2.37">I guess you could say you know here I am</text><text start="448.31" dur="2.04">privileged little sweet boy.</text><text start="451.64" dur="2.94">Why should I do these self-destructive things. What&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="454.58" dur="2.82">meaning for me to do that. And Frankel says</text><text start="457.46" dur="2.76">as well that you should live your life as if you&amp;#39;ve already</text><text start="460.22" dur="2.82">make made your mistakes as if you already</text><text start="463.04" dur="3">lived it and made all your mistakes because that changes</text><text start="466.04" dur="2.79">your approach to life in a meaningful way. And this</text><text start="468.83" dur="2.34">connects a lot to the ideas in my opinion around</text><text start="471.74" dur="2.7">reincarnation which sounds really weird for me to say but</text><text start="474.68" dur="2.76">it gives you a positive meaning and outlook on</text><text start="477.44" dur="2.97">life in my opinion. Regardless if you embrace the</text><text start="480.44" dur="2.43">religious and spiritual aspect of it</text><text start="483.38" dur="2.88">and regardless if you believe in that or not I</text><text start="486.26" dur="3">think is irrelevant or at least actually it is</text><text start="489.26" dur="2.73">relevant but it doesn&amp;#39;t really change anything and doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="491.99" dur="0.94">change the outcome.</text><text start="492.95" dur="2.82">I guess you could say if you have a meaning for something you can go through</text><text start="495.77" dur="2.66">any suffering in Buddhism treats life as</text><text start="498.44" dur="1.86">suffering. This became very weird.</text><text start="501.67" dur="2.94">Always my final point. Life sucks. I want to tell us and</text><text start="504.61" dur="2.85">touch upon that dystopian which I could</text><text start="507.62" dur="2.67">because I think that&amp;#39;s something that a lot of people like to start off</text><text start="510.29" dur="2.76">reading. Myself included one of the earliest</text><text start="513.05" dur="2.46">books that I read this year was brave new world</text><text start="515.9" dur="2.94">written by Aldous Huxley. I loved this one especially because</text><text start="518.84" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s a good mixture of comedy and intentional or not</text><text start="521.79" dur="2.96">I don&amp;#39;t know. And that is how grim it</text><text start="524.75" dur="2.88">gets as well how dark it is. We should really delivers</text><text start="527.87" dur="2.79">this impactful meaning behind it. I don&amp;#39;t want to go too</text><text start="530.66" dur="2.64">much into it sorry. But the main reason I&amp;#39;m bringing this up is</text><text start="533.3" dur="2.94">because a lot of you guys are recommending</text><text start="536.63" dur="2.31">this book to me which is Fahrenheit</text><text start="538.97" dur="2.97">451 which is another dystopia which</text><text start="541.94" dur="2.79">depicts a future where people won&amp;#39;t read books.</text><text start="544.91" dur="2.91">They have the same idea generally but I think</text><text start="547.82" dur="2.64">these are two great examples of this one has a great</text><text start="550.46" dur="2.91">elevator pitch this one dozen but this one has so much</text><text start="553.37" dur="2.85">more impactful meaning behind it. This just sounds to</text><text start="556.22" dur="2.94">me like the rambling of an angry</text><text start="559.16" dur="3">old man. This is the one that&amp;#39;s going to get a movie adapted to</text><text start="562.16" dur="2.97">it. I think Lily sings is even acting in it</text><text start="565.28" dur="1.02">so it&amp;#39;s gonna be great.</text><text start="567.99" dur="2.33">Golly golly</text><text start="571.72" dur="2.29">Phoebe and government controlled information</text><text start="574.1" dur="2.8">verses information in the media today. I</text><text start="576.95" dur="2.88">say pretty identical. Just go on any social media Web</text><text start="579.83" dur="2.89">site and you&amp;#39;ll see that there&amp;#39;s two sides to every story and everyone you</text><text start="582.72" dur="2.71">literally just sound like a crybaby and an idiot which you are.</text><text start="585.51" dur="2.95">Lately things it&amp;#39;s so bad. This book is so terrible</text><text start="588.47" dur="2.55">I think it&amp;#39;s a perfect example of a book that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="591.02" dur="2.94">moral is the core center of the</text><text start="594.08" dur="3">of the novel. Which just</text><text start="597.08" dur="2.84">makes it so goddamn boring in my opinion the beauty your</text><text start="599.96" dur="2.37">fiction is when you have characters that are</text><text start="602.33" dur="2.94">interesting and the story that really grips</text><text start="605.27" dur="3">you in a way that. The ideas behind</text><text start="608.27" dur="2.55">it isn&amp;#39;t as transparent and they have so much more</text><text start="610.82" dur="2.55">impact in my opinion. This is so</text><text start="613.37" dur="2.82">rambling so poorly written. It</text><text start="616.19" dur="2.76">blows my mind that this is what gets recommended.</text><text start="619.46" dur="2.88">Don&amp;#39;t read this one. There&amp;#39;s so many better dystopias out there.</text><text start="622.91" dur="2.79">Whenever you goal as well the top rated</text><text start="625.7" dur="2.67">books on the online and you see</text><text start="628.49" dur="2.85">see what&amp;#39;s popular there are a lot of it is a self-help</text><text start="631.34" dur="2.97">book which is fine. Obviously they have a purpose and</text><text start="634.37" dur="2.64">there&amp;#39;s a lot to learn from that as well. But I would really</text><text start="637.34" dur="2.85">emphasize that reading fiction read fiction</text><text start="640.34" dur="2.94">there&amp;#39;s really no better way to to get the meaning behind</text><text start="643.28" dur="2.85">something in my opinion instead of just getting it</text><text start="646.13" dur="2.55">spoon fed to you. And I hope that</text><text start="649.52" dur="2.79">more people get into reading fiction as well and don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="652.31" dur="2.88">just read non-fiction because I</text><text start="655.19" dur="2.85">know I have a lot of younger guys watching me and I know</text><text start="658.04" dur="2.97">younger guys generally tend to strayed more towards</text><text start="661.37" dur="1.47">nonfiction instead of fiction.</text><text start="662.96" dur="2.21">But you&amp;#39;re missing out okay. Did you get scared.</text><text start="665.36" dur="2.91">Extremely dark in here. God damn it. I think that&amp;#39;s all I</text><text start="668.27" dur="2.82">wanted to say. I could probably ramble on a lot more.</text><text start="671.15" dur="2.82">Thank you for listening so far. I again I</text><text start="673.97" dur="2.74">really hope this inspires more of you to read as well.</text><text start="677" dur="2.67">Because I had a lot of fun this year and I also would</text><text start="679.67" dur="2.82">recommend to start small. And</text><text start="682.49" dur="2.28">also maybe set a goal for yourself. I think</text><text start="685.19" dur="2.66">instead of reading 50 pages and then or 300</text><text start="687.89" dur="2.64">pages and stopping. It&amp;#39;s better to just read</text><text start="690.65" dur="2.77">something small like 10 pages a day. That&amp;#39;s</text><text start="693.43" dur="2.77">a banner if you were consistent with it at</text><text start="696.2" dur="2.91">least then stopping and I think you&amp;#39;ll find that you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="699.11" dur="2.94">get into it quicker than you think. Obviously if you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="702.05" dur="2.76">used to reading which I was in at the time it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="704.81" dur="1.3">little harder to get into.</text><text start="706.16" dur="2.84">But once you do it&amp;#39;s great</text><text start="709.28" dur="2.28">it&amp;#39;s really fun. If this video gets</text><text start="711.56" dur="2.61">5000 likes I will give</text><text start="714.17" dur="2.58">away my favorite book of the year</text><text start="717.32" dur="2.76">which is the cat in the hat.</text><text start="720.14" dur="2.96">Now they spoke.
